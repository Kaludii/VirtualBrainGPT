Today was a rollercoaster of emotions. As we enter the last week of senior year, it's finally hitting me that college is coming to an end. I spent most of the day working on my final project for the Capstone course. I can't believe I'm just a few days away from presenting it. In the evening, I met up with my friends for a study session, but we mostly spent the time reminiscing and laughing about our college adventures.

Another hectic day filled with finalizing projects and preparing for exams. I received an email from the Career Services office informing me of a potential job opportunity after graduation. The thought of starting my career is both exciting and nerve-wracking. I spent the evening with my roommate, talking about our post-graduation plans and the challenges we'll face in the "real world."

Today was the last day of classes! It's such a surreal feeling. My professors shared some words of wisdom and encouragement, which was very touching. After class, I attended a senior send-off event on campus, where we were given our caps and gowns. As we tried them on, the reality of graduating really set in. We took lots of photos to commemorate the moment.

It's officially finals week. I spent most of my day in the library, studying and finishing up my final papers. My friends and I took a break in the afternoon to grab some ice cream and enjoy the sunshine. We discussed our plans for the upcoming summer and our future careers. The conversation was bittersweet, as we know that we'll soon be parting ways and entering new chapters in our lives.

I had my first final exam this morning. I think it went well, but I'm just relieved it's over. I spent the rest of the day preparing for my Capstone presentation. I'm feeling pretty confident about it, and I can't wait to show my professor and classmates what I've been working on all semester. In the evening, I attended a pre-graduation party with my friends. We danced and sang, embracing every moment together.

Today was all about relaxation and self-care. I spent the morning catching up on sleep, then went for a run around campus to clear my head. In the afternoon, I attended a yoga class with my friends to destress before our final exams next week. It's important to find balance during these stressful times.

I'm in full-on study mode for my last two exams. The library was packed, but I managed to find a quiet spot to focus. I took a break in the evening to watch a movie with my roommates. It's our tradition to have a movie night every Sunday, and tonight's choice was a nostalgic throwback to our freshman year.

I completed my final exam today! It's hard to believe that my college journey is coming to an end. To celebrate, my friends and I went out for dinner at our favorite restaurant, reminiscing about our college experiences and sharing our hopes for the future. After dinner, we took a long walk around campus, stopping at all the memorable spots and taking pictures to capture these precious moments. As we walked, we couldn't help but feel a mix of happiness, sadness, and anticipation for what lies ahead.
